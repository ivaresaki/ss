    <h1>Welcome to SurgiScript</h1>

    <p>
        SURGISCRIPT™️ is a real time information sharing application accessible on smartphones, tablets, and desktops. 
        ​
        SURGISCRIPT™️ is an O.R. efficiency tool that consolidates information among clinicians, administrators, and O.R. staff. Surgeons can request specific staffing for their cases and assign performance ratings to their surgical team. Administrators can better plan the O.R schedule and utilize surgeon feedback along with data tracking statistics to optimize performance and maximize efficiency. SURGISCRIPT™️'s text messaging and video conferencing features are revolutionary concepts in the surgical setting.

        Connecting the complex network of surgical entities and their associated information is the main focus of SURGISCRIPT™️.

        SURGISCRIPT™️ resolves the universal issue of preference cards. SURGISCRIPT™️ catalogs the complete supply inventory of each facility you operate at. Using this catalog, you, or a designee, can update your card from anywhere anytime. Waiting for service coordinators to make changes for you is a element of the past.
        ​
        The SURGISCRIPT™️ is ready to be piloted at its first testing site.

        Welcome to the future of having total control in and out of the O.R: welcome to SURGISCRIPT™️.
